# realtime-sensordata

program.js fetches sensor data from B-Dataspace every 2 seconds and returns all data from the current day. If no sensor is active resp no data are available there will be no resuts (of course). Data are being loaded and returned via the log (Console Chrome Developer Tools). Bubbles behave indepently from that.
